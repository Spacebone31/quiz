                    <h4>OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT chatbot in classrooms</h4>
                    <p>OpenAI is considering the integration of its widely embraced ChatGPT chatbot into educational environments, 
                        aiming to harness transformative technology for learning purposes. Insights into this ambitious endeavour 
                        were shared by Brad Lightcap, Chief Operating Officer at OpenAI, during the INSEAD Americas Conference. 
                        The company plans to form a team to explore how ChatGPT can be seamlessly incorporated into educational 
                        environments with a focus on promoting responsible AI use in learning settings. The launch of ChatGPT 
                        initially raised concerns among the academic community about cheating and plagiarism. However, an 
                        increasing number of educators recognised its benefits for students in just a few months, leading OpenAI 
                        to delve deeper into its educational applications. OpenAI actively collaborates with educators, forming 
                        partnerships with education groups such as Khan Academy and collaborating with Schmidt Futures to provide 
                        grants to education groups in underserved communities. The company strives to inform educators about 
                        ChatGPT’s capabilities, potential benefits, and ongoing efforts to enhance its applications in educational 
                        settings.</p>
                    <h4>How can AI assist in the classroom?</h4>
                    <p>IF used responsibly, AI has the potential to optimise education by tailoring learning experiences and aiding 
                        both students and educators in various aspects of teaching and learning. It can assist in the classroom 
                        by personalising learning, automating teacher administrative tasks, providing adaptive learning experiences, 
                        and offering 24/7 student support through chatbots or virtual assistants.</p>
