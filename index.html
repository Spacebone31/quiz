            <h4>OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT chatbot in classrooms</h4>
            <p>OpenAI is considering the integration of its widely embraced ChatGPT chatbot into educational
                environments,
                aiming to harness transformative technology for learning purposes. Insights into this ambitious
                endeavour
                were shared by Brad Lightcap, Chief Operating Officer at OpenAI, during the INSEAD Americas
                Conference.
                The company plans to form a team to explore how ChatGPT can be seamlessly incorporated into
                educational
                environments with a focus on promoting responsible AI use in learning settings. The launch of
                ChatGPT
                initially raised concerns among the academic community about cheating and plagiarism. However, an
                increasing number of educators recognised its benefits for students in just a few months, leading
                OpenAI
                to delve deeper into its educational applications. OpenAI actively collaborates with educators,
                forming
                partnerships with education groups such as Khan Academy and collaborating with Schmidt Futures to
                provide
                grants to education groups in underserved communities. The company strives to inform educators about
                ChatGPT’s capabilities, potential benefits, and ongoing efforts to enhance its applications in
                educational
                settings.</p>
            <h4>How can AI assist in the classroom?</h4>
            <p>IF used responsibly, AI has the potential to optimise education by tailoring learning experiences and
                aiding
                both students and educators in various aspects of teaching and learning. It can assist in the
                classroom
                by personalising learning, automating teacher administrative tasks, providing adaptive learning
                experiences,
                and offering 24/7 student support through chatbots or virtual assistants.</p>
